# Welcome to ED Handbook

ED Handbook is the ultimate central guide for the game Elite: Dangerous. This is a project with individuals who are enthusiastic about the game and wish to help the community with quality resources, rich in information, and documented by experienced players with a deep understanding of the game and its mechanics. 

We are not endorsed by Elite Dangerous, we are not partnered with Elite Dangerous. ED Handbook is purely a collaborative passion project.
