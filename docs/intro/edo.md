# Welcome to Odyssey

Welcome to Elite Dangerous Odyssey. This is the expansion package for on-foot content in the game, Elite Dangerous. Let's look at the first steps you will take as a commander with on-foot access. The game puts you into their [Holo Me]() character builder.(1) 
{.annotate}

1.  ![Holo Me Saves](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1255311783044841515/1333621262018416692/image.png?ex=67998f16&is=67983d96&hm=f3b16b215b0030da8fcd40d008f452fed8a465a9adb2a4ebf4ffc8231b2b57f9&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1179&height=663) <br></br> Just note that Holo Me characters do not correspond to individual commander save files. You can have multiple Holo Me characters loadouts for one individual commander save file. 

The game will then put you into their tutorial gameplay. It is not necessary to complete this tutorial, but you will learn how to use some very basic gameplay mechanics. After completing this tutorial, or being absolutely confident in your First Person Shooter abilities and skipping the tutorial, the game will put you in a station called [Chamberlain's Rest]() in the [HIP 97950]() system. The game will loan you a free Sidewinder ship to start with.(1)

ARX is a cosmetic currency that is earned passively in the game by doing activities, or it can be purchased with money from the game's ARX store. 

## Chamberlain's Rest, HIP 97950

Chamberlain's Rest is a planetary starport in the system HIP 97950. This will be your starting point station and system. HIP 97950 is a permit-locked system controlled by the Pilot's Federation as a system for pilots who are rankless. 

### Looking around the Station

![Concourse](../assets/images/welcomeguides/concourse.png)

Every station will have a lounge area. In Elite Dangerous, we call it the "concourse". You'll notice for Chamberlain's Rest, there is an upper section, and a lower section with different shops and services. Let's take a look around the station.

#### Upper Section of the Station

        Apex Interstellar shuttles will require you to pay a small fee for however long the shuttle flies for. Apex shuttles can also be called to rescue you if you find your ship destroyed while exploring systems or planets that are within reach of apex's range.

        Accessing the elevators to your Apex shuttles can be located by walking past the service desk, turning left and crossing the bridge to the left of the station.

## Personal Loadout & Equipment

For Odyssey, you will be given a basic flight suit and a weapon as your very basic loadout. You may purchase more specialized suits from any stations with a Pioneer Supplies market. There are three suits available to you to purchase, and a total of 11 kinds of weapons. 

### Suits

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- 

    Suits are functional pieces of equipment that your character wears. Each suit has their own unique functionalities, and capacity. All suits will have a primary weapon slot, along with an Energy Link and a Profile Analyser tool. Your character will be given a free Flight Suit and a P-15 kinetic type pistol at the start. Let's take a look at the differences of every ship.

    === "Flight Suit"

        ![Flight Suit](../assets/images/welcomeguides/layoutposters/flight_poster.png)

        Flight suits are a very basic non-engineerable suit that pilots in Horizons will wear, along with the basic suit given to you at the very beginning of the game. There is nothing unique about this suit, other than it is worn by players who do not have Odyssey and can be cosmetically altered.(1)
        {.annotate}

        1.  You cannot purchase additional flight suits. You will only be given one Flight Suit per CMDR save file.

    === "Maverick Suit"

        ![Maverick Suit](../assets/images/welcomeguides/layoutposters/maverick_poster.png)

        Maverick suit is useful for salvaging materials from settlements and planetary points of interests. The Maverick suit has the largest carrying capacity, along with a special suit tool called the "Arc Cutter". The Arc Cutter is able to cut through access panels, and open locked crates with a red lock. The Maverick suit should be one of the first suits you should be considering to get as it's utilitarian versatility is great.

    === "Artemis Suit"

        ![Artemis Suit](../assets/images/welcomeguides/layoutposters/artemis_poster.png)

        If you are a keen explorer and you wish to go out and explore the galaxy on foot, then the Artemis Suit is a great option for you. It's life support and power consumption are the best out of the 4 suits making it a great suit to wear for exploring surfaces of planets for long term. The Artemis suit also comes with the Genetic Sampler, used to collect organic exobiology matter. Exobiology is one of the higher paying activities for early-game access.

    === "Dominator Suit"

        ![Dominator Suit](../assets/images/welcomeguides/layoutposters/dominator_poster.png)

        The Dominator suit, as the name suggests, is a combat-oriented suit. It does not have a suit-specific tool, but rather a carrying capacity for an extra secondary weapon. Dominator suits have the best armor and shield stats out of all 4 suits, making it a force to be reckoned with. This suit also has the highest consumeable carrying limit of any suits, making it a very heavy suit to move in.

    E-breaches are considered an illegal item, and if a settlement security guard scans you, a bounty will be placed on your head. So avoid being scanned if you are carrying E-breaches.

### Personal Loadouts

You can name your loadout saves so you know what suit and weapon combination that loadout has. You can put the same handheld weapon with other suits. You can choose which loadout you are wearing, by;

* using the station computer to select and customize your loadouts.
* using the ship's role panel when seated in a ship.

## Early Game Activities

Alright, we have covered about concourse and its services, your suits and handheld weapons, let's look at some early access activities that is recommended for new Odyssey commanders. There are three paths one can take on, however you are not limited to taking only these three paths. 

![Early Game Content](../assets/images/welcomeguides/earlygamecontent.png)

* You can go and jump start in Exobiology. Exobiology is one of the more lucrative money-making activities for early access gameplay. All you need is a Artemis suit and a jump-capable ship. 
* You can purchase a Maverick suit and take on Restoration missions. Restoration missions's object is to power on an abandoned settlement. You are given level 3 access to all buildings in the settlement and therefore you can loot any materials left in this settlement at no risk of being caught.
* If you don't like Odyssey and wish to explore more of the systems within the core bubble, then you can pilot your Sidewinder and explore elsewhere.
