# Manufactured Materials

Manufactured materials as the name suggests, are a category of materials commonly found from salvage signal sources, can be obtained from destroying other ships, and can be obtained as a mission reward. As of late, engineering has been given an update(1)in that high grade materials can be obtained in abundance.

## High Grade Emissions

High Grade Emissions are signal sources that generate in any populated systems.(2)High Grades yeild most high-grade manufactured materials, except for Biotech Components and Exquisite Focus Crystals, both of which are only obtained as mission rewards.(1)

1.  Since the recent update, as the mission board rewards are populated by having more material-related rewards show up, the rarity of Biotech Conductors and Exquisite Focus Crystals has increased, making it rather difficult to find these materials from mission rewards.

2. High Grades are becoming rarer to find since the release of the Ascendency Update for Power Play. System populate more power-related signal sources than High Grade Emissions.

| Proto Radiollic Alloys | Boom | Independent / Alliance | Obtained by Rewards |
| Improvised Components | Civil Unrest | Independent / Alliance | Obtained by Rewards |
| Pharmaceutical Isolators | Outbreak | Independent / Alliance | Obtained by Rewards |
| Military Grade Alloys | Civil War / War | Independent / Alliance | Obtained by Rewards |
| Military Supercapacitors | Civil War / War | Independent / Alliance | Obtained by Rewards |
| Biotech Conductors | N/a | N/a | Only Obtained from Rewards |
| Equisite Focus Crystals | N/a | N/a | Only Obtained from Rewards |

## Abandoned Sites

This is the legacy method of collecting Manufactured materials. Although it is commonly referred by players in the community for being openly accessible to all, it is a very inefficient as low to medium grade materials are collected. Completing missions and scouting for High Grades are generally preferred over this method.

## Collection Through Combat

!!! example inline end "Hot Jupiter"

    This is a system where a Gas Giant orbits around it's host star at close proximity. The system resides in an anarchy, unpopulated system, whereby illegal actions are not regulated. By killing tourist ships, may net you a pool of manufactured materials.

Combat in general of enemy ships are another source of manufactured materials. Depending on the ship category and skill level, the quality of engineering materials increases. Large ships can drop some Grade 5 materials, smaller ships drops low grade materials.
