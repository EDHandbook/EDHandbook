# Technology Brokers

Technology Brokers are a dealer service found commonly in stations in high populated, and high security systems. There are some experimental and hybrid modules in Elite Dangerous that can only be access after unlocking it with a Technology Broker. These modules and weapons are all unlocked with a recipe. Some modules and weapons are a permanent unlock that allows the player to access it with credits, while some modules and weapons can only be purchased with a set of materials and commodities. Technology brokers are also broken up into two types. Pre-engineered items can also be unlocked through a Technology Broker. 

* Human Technology Brokers that can unlock experimental modules and weapons such as thargoid-hybrid derivatives.
* Guardian Technology Brokers are ones who specialize in unlocking Guardian-hybrid modules and weapons.
