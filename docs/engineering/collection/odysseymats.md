    The following content is for players who have the Odyssey DLC add-on. Unfortunately, Odyssey will not be accessible in Horizons 4.0 and there you must have selected the DLC in order to have access to the contents. 

# Odyssey Materials

Odyssey Materials were introduced into Elite: Dangerous following the Odyssey expansion in 2020 and the release of on-foot activities and its content. Odyssey Materials are used to upgrade both personal suit and weapons. Suits and weapons can be upgraded at pioneer supplies, engineers are used to apply specialized modifications.

## Odyssey Material Types

Odyssey Materials are split into 3 categories, Assets, Goods, and Data.

* Assets are a collection of different subcategories of **Technology**, **Circuits**, and **Chemicals**.
* Goods, as the name suggest, are a bundle of products that can be found around locked containers and lockers. 
* Data can be downloaded from data points located across the settlement. 

Only Assets can be traded through a Bartender, an Odyssey materials trader, within the asset's categories, and cannot be cross-traded to other asset subcategories. Goods and Data can only be sold(1).
