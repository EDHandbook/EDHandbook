# Engineering

Engineering is the repeat process of collecting materials, unlocking engineers, and applying modifications and their experimental effects to enhance the versatility of a ship's capabilities. Engineering is recommended for anyone who wants to engage in more advanced gameplay activities with a modified ship, lowering the entry level.

Engineering can be broken up in 3 segments. You'll first need to source and collect materials. You'll then need to unlock engineers who are able to create recipes. And lastly, modify and enjoy your engineered ship.

## Collection of Materials

Here are 8 resources to help with materials collection for engineering.

## Unlocking Engineers

Let's look into how to unlock engineers, as each engineer has a different set of referral, meeting, and unlocking requirements.
